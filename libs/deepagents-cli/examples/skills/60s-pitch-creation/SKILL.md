# Skill: 60-Second Pitch Creation (黄金60秒)

## Purpose
This skill generates a clear, emotionally resonant, high-conversion 60-second entrepreneurial pitch following the three-part 黄金60秒 structure:

1. **Pain Point Resonance** — Describe the target user and amplify the pain with six resonance dimensions.  
2. **Team Advantage Statement** — Highlight strengths using the five advantage dimensions.  
3. **Call to Action (CTA)** — Provide a compelling, low-friction next step.

The pitch is ideal for investor intros, co-founder recruitment, WeChat group openings, demo days, and viral short-video scripts.

## Required Inputs
This skill expects the following to already be available in the agent state:
- A defined business idea  
- A clear pain point (raw or enhanced)  
- A target persona (if available)  
- Team or founder advantages  
- General solution concept  

If any of these are missing, the skill should ask 2–3 clarifying questions before producing a pitch.

## Framework

### 1. Pain Point Resonance (Six Dimensions)
A strong pitch must express at least one of the following emotional-resonance dimensions:

1. **Urgency** — Why this pain must be solved now  
2. **Frequency** — How often the user experiences the pain  
3. **Economic Cost** — Financial waste or missed opportunity  
4. **Universality** — How many people experience the issue  
5. **Viral Spread of the Pain** — The problem is spreading rapidly in society  
6. **Regulatory / Environmental Pressure** — New laws or external factors force change  

### 2. Team Advantage Statement (Five Dimensions)
Select the most relevant 1–3 of the following:

1. **Exceptional Founder Background** (“百里挑一”)  
2. **Lower Market Entry Barrier / Near-zero CAC**  
3. **10× Solution** — One powerful insight or feature that is indisputably superior  
4. **Natural User Acquisition Channels**  
5. **Competitive Moat / Defensibility**  

### 3. Call to Action (CTA)
The CTA must be:
- Low-friction  
- Specific  
- Attractive  
- Appropriate for early-stage engagement  

Examples:  
“Join our early test user group.”  
“Talk with us if you're exploring this area.”  
“Become one of our first pilot partners.”

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when:
- The user explicitly requests help creating a pitch  
- The conversation has produced a valid business idea, pain point, and advantage set  
- The agent detects the user's need to persuade (recruit, fundraise, or present)

Do NOT use this skill:
- Before a business idea is identified  
- Before pain point and team advantages are clarified  

## What This Skill Produces
- A polished, emotionally resonant 60-second pitch (120–200 words)  
- A breakdown of which pain and advantage dimensions were used  
- Optional clarifying questions if key inputs are missing
