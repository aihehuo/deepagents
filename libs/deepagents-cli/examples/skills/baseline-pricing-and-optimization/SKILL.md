description: Establishes baseline pricing from value delivered, then generates pricing-variation tactics (split selling, cross-selling, upselling) and identifies key partners who can reduce cost or boost sales complexity. This skill is used after the customer segment and value proposition are clarified.

# Skill: Baseline Pricing & Business Model Optimization

## Purpose
This skill helps the entrepreneur define a clear baseline price and generate scalable business-model optimization opportunities.  
It assumes that **Customer Segment** and **Value Proposition** are already fixed and clarified.

The skill performs three major functions:
1. **Establish Baseline Pricing** using the 1/10 value rule for early adopters.  
2. **Generate Variant Pricing using three tactics:**  
   - Split selling  
   - Cross-selling  
   - Upselling  
3. **Identify Strategic Partners** who can either:  
   - Increase unit price (value boosters)  
   - Reduce sales complexity (distribution boosters)

This unified assessment prepares the entrepreneur for profitability optimization.

## Baseline Pricing Logic (1/10 Value Rule)
The baseline price is defined as:

> **Baseline Price = 1/10 × Estimated Value Delivered to the Early Adopter**

Where:
- *Value delivered* is the monetary impact, savings, revenue improvement, or emotional utility quantified for early adopters.
- This benchmark provides a rational anchor for pricing experimentation.

If the estimated value is unclear, the skill should ask clarifying questions.

## Pricing Optimization Tactics

### 1. Split Selling (Lower Entry Barrier)
Sell a smaller portion of the baseline offer to reduce friction and sales complexity.  
Examples:
- A starter version  
- A mini-package  
- A simplified module  
- A low-commitment trial  

Purpose:
- Increase conversion  
- Move left on the sales-complexity axis  

---

### 2. Cross-Selling (Horizontal Choice Expansion)
Provide alternative products/services at similar price ranges.  
Examples:
- Variants, flavors, modules  
- Additional items at similar price levels  
- Menu or bundle options  

Purpose:
- Increase revenue per user batch  
- Match diverse preferences without raising price  

---

### 3. Upselling (Higher Value Tier)
Provide a premium, enhanced, or extended version of the offer.  
Examples:
- Premium tier  
- Advanced features  
- Done-for-you service  
- Enterprise package  

Purpose:
- Increase unit price  
- Move up on the profitability axis

## Key Partner Optimization

### 1. Essential Enabler Partners (Fixed)
Partners required to operate at all.  
Examples:
- Cloud hosting  
- Payment processors  
- Manufacturers  
These are not optimized; they define operational constraints.

---

### 2. Strategic Partners (Variable, Optimizable)
Partners who improve profitability by:

#### A. **Increasing Unit Price**
Partners who boost perceived value or credibility, enabling higher pricing.
Examples:
- Industry experts  
- Trusted institutions  
- Influencers with authority  
- Platform integration partners  

#### B. **Reducing Sales Complexity**
Partners who bring customers or reduce CAC.
Examples:
- Affiliates  
- Resellers  
- Agencies  
- Distribution channels  
- SaaS marketplaces  

These partners shift the business model:
- **Upward** (more price)  
- **Leftward** (less sales effort)

## When to Use This Skill
Use after:
- Customer segment is defined  
- Value proposition is clarified  
- Pain point is understood  

Do NOT use this skill:
- Before identifying a clear business idea  
- Before clarifying customer + value proposition
