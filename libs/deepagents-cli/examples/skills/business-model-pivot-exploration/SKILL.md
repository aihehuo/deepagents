# Skill: Business Model Pivot Exploration

## Purpose
This skill systematically explores **seven alternative business models** to help the entrepreneur pivot or brainstorm new directions beyond their existing model.  
Given a clarified product/service, this skill generates multiple business-model options, each with distinct customer segments, value propositions, revenue mechanics, feasibility, risks, and profitability impacts.

The goal is to discover business-model variations that may:
- Increase unit price  
- Reduce sales complexity  
- Unlock new revenue pathways  
- Improve scalability  

This skill expands strategic optionality and supports informed pivot decisions.

## The Seven Business Model Archetypes

### 1. Retail Model  
Customers pay a fixed price for a product.  
- Simple purchase  
- Low-to-medium sales complexity  
- One-time revenue  

### 2. Service Model  
Customers pay for labor, specialized support, or expertise.  
- Higher perceived value  
- Higher sales complexity  
- Premium pricing potential  

### 3. Brokerage Model  
You connect two parties and earn a commission for matching them.  
- Highly scalable  
- Requires trust and marketplace liquidity  
- Two-sided value proposition  

### 4. Transaction Model  
You earn a commission for processing payment or asset transfer.  
- Extremely scalable  
- Volume-driven  
- Sticky once integrated  

### 5. Subscription Model  
Customers pay recurring fees for access to content or a service.  
- Predictable revenue  
- Lower post-acquisition sales complexity  
- High lifetime value  

### 6. Usage-Based Model  
Customers pay based on consumption volume.  
- Fair, transparent pricing → easier adoption  
- High revenue ceiling  
- Complexity depends on customer scale  

### 7. Membership Model  
Customers pay recurring fees for belonging to a community or gaining exclusive status/benefits.  
- Emotion-driven retention  
- Higher willingness-to-pay  
- Low sales complexity with strong brand or identity appeal

## What the Skill Should Produce

For **each** of the seven business models, the skill should provide:

### 1. Customer Segment  
A reinterpretation of who the customers would be if this model were used.

### 2. Value Proposition  
How the offering would need to be reframed to match this model.

### 3. Revenue Logic  
How money is earned under this model.

### 4. Implementation Example  
A concrete illustration of how the user’s product or service would operate under this model.

### 5. Profitability Impact  
Evaluate how the model affects the two axes of profitability:
- **Unit Price Effect:** higher / lower + explanation  
- **Sales Complexity Effect:** higher / lower + explanation  

### 6. Feasibility  
What resources, capabilities, or systems are required to operate this model.

### 7. Risks  
Potential issues or barriers relevant to this model.

After all seven are generated, the skill should summarize the results and highlight the **top 1–2 most promising business models**, including why they outperform the user’s current model on profitability and scalability.

If the product/service is unclear, ask clarifying questions before generating pivot options.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to brainstorm new business models  
- The existing model seems unscalable or low-profit  
- The entrepreneur is exploring pivots  
- The agent has a clear understanding of the product/service  

Do NOT use this skill:
- Before a clear product/service is identified  
- Before understanding the pain point and target user  
- When the user seeks only pricing optimization (use the pricing skill instead)
