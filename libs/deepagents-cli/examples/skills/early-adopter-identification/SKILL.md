description: Identifies the early adopter segment - the first batch of customers who are most willing to try the product, have been actively seeking solutions, and are value-sensitive rather than price-sensitive. Early adopters are a subset of the target persona who are more desperate and actively seeking a solution.

# Skill: Early Adopter Identification

## Purpose
This skill identifies the **early adopter segment** - the first batch of customers who will be most receptive to trying the first-generation product, even if it comes with flaws and imperfections. Early adopters are the target audience for the 60-second pitch and represent a critical subset of the broader target persona who are more willing, more actively seeking, and more desperate for a solution.

Early adopters are not the same as the general target persona. While they share the persona's characteristics, they represent a smaller percentage who exhibit greater urgency, higher willingness to try new solutions, and less price sensitivity in exchange for value.

## The Five Characteristics of Early Adopters

When identifying early adopters, look for customers who exhibit ALL of these characteristics:

### 1. Clearly Resonate with the Pain Point
Early adopters have a deep, personal understanding of the problem. They can articulate the pain point clearly and feel it acutely. They don't just acknowledge the problem exists - they experience it regularly and feel it strongly.

### 2. Willing to Try First-Generation Products Despite Flaws
Early adopters are willing to try imperfect solutions. They understand that first-generation products come with limitations, bugs, or incomplete features. They're willing to work with the product through iterations and provide feedback. They value being part of the solution's development journey.

### 3. Value-Sensitive, Not Price-Sensitive
Early adopters prioritize value over price. They're willing to pay premium prices if the product delivers meaningful value or solves their problem effectively. Price is secondary to getting a solution that works. They understand that early-stage products may cost more due to smaller scale or custom approaches.

### 4. Actively Seeking Solutions (Trying Hard or DIY)
Early adopters have been actively trying to solve the problem themselves. They may have:
- Searched extensively for existing solutions
- Tried multiple alternatives (even imperfect ones)
- Built DIY (do-it-yourself) workarounds or solutions
- Invested significant time and effort trying to address the pain point
- Participated in forums, communities, or discussions about the problem

This characteristic indicates they're not passive - they're actively seeking and willing to try new approaches.

### 5. Not Limited by Geographical or Economic Constraints
Early adopters are willing to overcome barriers that would stop regular customers:
- **Geographical**: They'll travel, use remote solutions, or adapt to location-based limitations
- **Economic**: They have resources or are willing to allocate budget to solve the problem (not constrained by strict budget limits that prevent trying new solutions)
- **Accessibility**: They'll overcome technical barriers, learning curves, or adoption challenges

This doesn't mean they're wealthy or geographically mobile in general - rather, they prioritize solving THIS specific problem enough to overcome normal constraints.

## Required Inputs

This skill expects the following to already be available in the agent state:
- A defined business idea
- A clarified target persona
- An enhanced pain point (with emotional resonance dimensions)

If any of these are missing, the skill should ask 2–3 clarifying questions before identifying early adopters.

## What This Skill Produces

The skill should produce:

1. **Early Adopter Profile**: A refined persona description focusing on the subset of the target persona who are early adopters, highlighting the five characteristics above.

2. **How Early Adopters Differ from the General Persona**: Clear explanation of what makes early adopters distinct from the broader target customer segment.

3. **Early Adopter Behaviors & Indicators**: Specific behaviors, signals, or characteristics that can help identify early adopters in the real world (e.g., "They've tried 3+ competing solutions," "They post in online forums about this problem," "They've built custom scripts/workarounds").

4. **Where to Find Early Adopters**: Suggestions for where these early adopters congregate, gather, or can be reached (communities, forums, platforms, events, etc.).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The target persona has been clarified
- The pain point has been enhanced
- You need to identify who should be the target audience for the 60-second pitch
- You're preparing to create a pitch or launch strategy

Do NOT use this skill:
- Before a target persona is clarified
- Before the pain point is enhanced
- When the business idea is still vague or undefined
