# Skill: Pain Point Enhancement

## Purpose
This skill takes a user's initial pain point—whether vague, shallow, or incomplete—and enhances it into a clearer, more emotionally resonant, and more actionable problem statement.  
It does this by analyzing and enriching the pain point through **six specific dimensions of emotional resonance**, helping the entrepreneur articulate the problem in a way that motivates action, attracts co-founders, and strengthens downstream business-planning logic.

This skill is typically used **after** a business idea has been identified but **before** persona refinement or solution design.

## The Six Dimensions of Pain Point Enhancement
A pain point can be strengthened by enhancing one or more of the following dimensions:

### 1. **Urgency**
How quickly and intensely the problem demands attention.  
Does it cause immediate stress, danger, frustration, or disruption?

### 2. **Frequency**
How often the problem occurs (daily, weekly, recurring).

### 3. **Economic Cost**
Financial losses, inefficiencies, waste, or missed opportunities caused by the problem.  
Economic cost can be personal, business-related, or societal.

### 4. **Universality**
How many people or organizations face this problem.  
Is it limited to a niche group, or is it widespread across demographics?

### 5. **Viral Spread of the Problem**
Not viral marketing.  
This dimension measures whether the *number of people experiencing the pain is rapidly increasing*, like a “problem pandemic.”

### 6. **Regulatory or Environmental Pressure**
Whether new laws, industry rules, or external changes *force* people to address the problem, creating urgency even where none existed before.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill when:
- The user has described a pain point but it is weak, unclear, or lacks emotional impact.
- The agent needs a stronger, more grounded problem statement for business planning.
- The pain point feels too generic and needs sharpening.
- The user expresses confusion about why the problem matters or how severe it is.

Do NOT use this skill:
- Before a business idea has been identified (use business-idea-evaluation first).
- After the business plan is already finalized (unless the user asks to refine the problem statement).

## What This Skill Produces
This skill outputs:
- A rewritten, enhanced pain point with emotional resonance.
- A breakdown of how the pain point scores across each of the six dimensions.
- A brief explanation of which dimensions matter most for this specific idea.
- Optional clarifying questions if essential information is missing from the user's description.

## How the Agent Should Use This Skill
1. Extract the raw pain point from the user's idea or message.
2. Evaluate it across all six resonance dimensions.
3. Strengthen the pain point by:
   - sharpening language,
   - grounding it in real consequences,
   - making the emotional weight clearer,
   - highlighting the dimensions that apply.
4. Ask clarifying questions **only if necessary**.
5. Output the improved pain point using the required format.
