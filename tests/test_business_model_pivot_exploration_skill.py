"""Integration test for business-model-pivot-exploration skill.

1. Skill discovery - the skill is found and loaded correctly
2. Skill usage - the agent picks up and uses the skill
3. Outcome validation - the agent produces business model pivot exploration in the expected format
4. Dependency check - skill is not used before business idea and product/service are clarified
